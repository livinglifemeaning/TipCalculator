### Notes
- Estimated Time: 2hrs : Actual Time: like 6/7hrs 
- it took me a long time to figure out useContext... watched tutorials and stuff but wasn't working... slept on it and woke up knowing a solution. I don't know if it was the best solution but hey. 
- How to keep the card from stretching that mutch automatically? Why can't it just be the size it needs to be based off of what's inside it? 
-Didn't figure out how to reset the "custom" input - come back to at some point
